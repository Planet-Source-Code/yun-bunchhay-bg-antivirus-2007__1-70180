</div>

### Description

contain many features to help clean virus on the computer.

For some codes, I have taken from the website (maybe here) and all credits will go to the original developers. I actually developed this project to be my personal tool to help me eliminate viruses, such enable registry, end some processes, delete all viruses which are the same, etc...

To be better application, your advice are valuable.

PS. Can anyone help me find some ideas about Real-time scanning?

Any feedback is appreciated.
